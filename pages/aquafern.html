    <h6>Description: The Aquafern is a delicate underwater plant with translucent fronds that sway gently in the ocean currents. It absorbs sunlight through its iridescent leaves, which emit a soft, ethereal glow. They thrive in the shallow coastal regions and sunlit shallows of Aquaria, where it forms underwater meadows and dense clusters along rocky outcrops. Aquaferns have a relatively short lifespan, typically lasting several standard Aquarian years before reproducing and regenerating through spores and fragments.<h6>
